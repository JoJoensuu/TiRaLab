# Weekly report for week 5

### What have I done this week?
- Added board evaluations for when minimax depth reaches maximum
- Significant performance improvements to minimax algo
- AI now works and correctly blocks player moves
- Peer review

### How has the program advanced?
- A lot now that I understand how board states should be evaluated for the minimax to work efficiently
- AI is very good, but it gets slower the more the game advances as it needs to account for more and more adjacent cells

### What are my plans for next week?
- Probably documentation since that is lacking as of now
- I think it's possible still to improve performance, will seek teacher advice on this

### Time spent on project
- 12 hours
