# Weekly report for week 4

### What have I done this week?
- Not much to be done. Minimax is working correctly. Cells are saved in a 2d array.
- Available moves are calculated at the beginning of the game and from there the array is updated instead of recalculated.
- Minimax is checking for immediate wins first.
- Alpha-beta pruning works.
