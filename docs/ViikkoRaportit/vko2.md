# Weekly report for week 2

### What have I done this week?
- Working minimax with alpha-beta pruning
- Proper handling of availableCells state with a 2d array that is updated every turn
- Fixed tests to ensure minimax is working correctly

### How has the program advanced?
- Minimax is working correctly
- Use of Javascript and React browser app limits memory usage so depth complexity cant realistically be increased from 5

### What are my plans for next week?
- Some more tests to ensure minimax is returning correct values and scores from certain depths and nodes

### Time spent on project
- 12 hours
